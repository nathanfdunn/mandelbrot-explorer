A, B in Num
C := A*B
a, b in float
d := a*b
d = f(D) -> D = g(d)
a = f(A)
b = f(B)

g = f**-1

a*b == f(A)*f(B) == f(f(A*B))
=>
g(a*b) == f(A*B)
g(d) == f(C)
=>
D == f(C)

maxInt = maxVal
maxVal -> maxFloat

But then again, I am defining the function based on
how much I want to truncate, not the other way around.
Therefore...Idk

So 
X +-> x = X / (maxWord / maxVal)

Since we are defining maxFloat = maxWord
